# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction - Final Report

## Executive Summary
This project developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The model achieves 83% accuracy and provides a potential ROI of 1,961% when implemented with retention strategies. The analysis identified key factors that influence customer churn, with month-to-month contracts being the most significant predictor.

## Business Problem
Customer churn represents a significant challenge for telecom companies. Acquiring new customers is much more expensive than retaining existing ones, making effective churn prediction and prevention critical for business success.

## Data Overview
The dataset consisted of 7,043 customer records with 38 features including:
- Demographics (age, gender, marital status)
- Service details (contract type, offerings, internet type)
- Financial information (monthly charges, total charges)
- Engagement metrics (referrals, tenure)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned data, handled missing values, corrected negative monetary values
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created derived features like tenure in years, premium service count, and spend ratio
3. **Model Development**: 
   - Handled class imbalance using SMOTE
   - Trained multiple classification models
   - Selected Gradient Boosting as the best performer
   - Optimized hyperparameters via randomized search
4. **Threshold Optimization**: Found the
